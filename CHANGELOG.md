## Changes

### 0.17.0 (January 31, 2022)

This release incorporates nearly a year of minor changes, starts testing
against Ruby 3 and up, plus Rails 7. We've not heard of any incompatibilities
yet, but there are known issues around asset handling ([notably with
sassc][#2091]) that we're working on.

[#2091]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/issues/2091

The following templates have changed since v0.16.0:

  app/views/administrate/application/_collection.html.erb
