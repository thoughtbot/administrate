  s.description = <<-DESCRIPTION
Administrate is heavily inspired by projects like Rails Admin and ActiveAdmin,
but aims to provide a better user experience for site admins,
and to be easier for developers to customize.

To do that, we're following a few simple rules:

- No DSLs (domain-specific languages)
- Support the simplest use cases,
  and let the user override defaults with standard tools
  such as plain Rails controllers and views.
- Break up the library into core components and plugins,
  so each component stays small and easy to maintain.
