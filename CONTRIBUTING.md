## Code of Conduct

## Getting Started

Administrate is a [Rails Engine][], but ships with everything needed to
contribute and test new changes.

To maintain compatibility with multiple dependency versions, we use
[Appraisal][].

[Rails Engine]: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html
[Appraisal]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal

### Opening a PR

1. Fork the repo,
2. Run `./bin/setup` to install the base dependencies and setup a local
   database,
3. Run the test suite: `bundle exec rspec && bundle exec appraisal rspec`,
4. Make your changes,
5. Push your fork and open a pull request.

A good PR will solve the smallest problem it possibly can, have good test
coverage and (where necessary) have internationalisation support.

### Running the application locally

Administrate's demo application can be run like any Rails application:

```sh
bundle exec rails s
```

This will start the application defined in `spec/example_app`.

## Repository Structure

* The gem's source code lives in the `app` and `lib` subdirectories.
* The demo app is nested within `spec/example_app`.
* The guides as seen at [https://administrate-demo.herokuapp.com][docs] live
  as Markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory.

Rails configuration files have been changed
to recognize the app in the new location,
so running the server or deploying to Heroku works normally.

With this structure, developing a typical feature looks like:

* Add tests in `spec/`
* Implement a feature in `administrate/`
* Exercise the feature using the demo rails app (`spec/example_app/app/`)

## Front-end Architecture

This project uses:

* Sass
* [BEM]-style CSS selectors, with [namespaces]
* Autoprefixer
* SCSS-Lint, with [Hound] ([configuration](.scss-lint.yml))
* A variety of CSS units:
  - `em` for typographical-related elements
  - `rem` for lengths related to components
  - `px` for borders, text shadows, etc.
  - `vw`/`vh` for lengths that should be relational to the viewport

## Labels

Issues and PRs are split into two levels of labels, at the higher level:

* `feature`: new functionality that’s not yet implemented,
* `bug`: breakages in functionality that is implemented,
* `maintenance`: to keep up with changes around us

…and then to more specific themes:

* `namespacing`: models with a namespace,
* `installing`: initial setup, first-run experience, generators,
* `i18n`: translations and language support,
* `views-and-styles`: how administrate looks and is interacted with,
* `dashboards`: how administrate presents fields and displays data,
* `search`: finding things through our models,
* `sorting`: ordering things on dashboards,
* `pagination`: how we handle lots of data in small chunks,
* `security`: controlling data access through authorisation,
* `fields`: new fields, displaying and editing data,
* `models`: models, associations and fetching the underlying data,
* `documentation`: how to use Administrate, examples and common usage,
* `dependencies`: changes or issues relating to a dependency

## Releasing

New releases (and the time period between them) is arbitrary, but usually
motivated by a new Rails release or enough bug fixes or features that
there's significant enough changes.

A new release involves cutting and pushing a new version to [Ruby Gems][] and
then deploying that version of the example application and documentation. This
means that [the demo application][demo] always matches the current release,
whilst [the pre-release application][pre-release] will track current `master`.

[Ruby Gems]: https://rubygems.org/gems/administrate
[demo]: https://administrate-demo.herokuapp.com/
[pre-release]: https://administrate-demo-prerelease.herokuapp.com/
