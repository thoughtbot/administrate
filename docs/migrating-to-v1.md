title: Migrating to v1
---

In the release of v1.0.0, we [began bundling assets in the gem itself][2397].
In the future, this should mean that any changes made to assets (coming
from you or from Administrate updates) should not have an effect on you.
However, this is quite a big change and so you might find some problems.

As with most upgrades, if you're upgrading between versions with changes to the
templates, and if you've customised them, you may need to apply recent changes.
You can see those which changed in the [CHANGELOG][].

This applies to both modified files in `app/views/admin` and `app/views/fields`
if you have your own Field classes defined. A good way is to use the same 
command to generate the view as for the earlier version:
`rails generate administrate:views:ACTION MyModel`
noting the changes and re-applying the modifications

## Reported issues

### Removal of the `sprockets-rails` transitive dependency

[Issue][2514]

Previously, Administrate depended on [`sprockets-rails`][], if you have a
dependency which requires this, you may now need to add a direct dependency on
your application.
