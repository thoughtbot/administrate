# Getting Started

Administrate is released as a Ruby gem, and can be installed on Rails
applications version 4.2 or greater.

Add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "administrate"
```

Re-bundle, then run the installer:

```bash
$ rails generate administrate:install
```

The installer adds some new routes to your `config/routes.rb`,
and creates a controller at `app/controllers/admin/application_controller.rb`

In addition, the generator creates a `Dashboard` and a `Controller` for each of
your ActiveRecord resources:

- `app/controllers/admin/foos_controller.rb`
- `app/dashboards/foo_dashboard.rb`

The `Admin::ApplicationController` can be customized to add
authentication logic, authorization, pagination,
or other controller-level concerns.

You will also want to add a `root` route to show a dashboard when you go to `/admin`.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
    # Add dashboard for your models here
    resources :customers,
    resources :orders

    root to: "customers#index" # <--- Root route
  end
 end
```

Removing resources from the routes will hide them on the dashboard.

There might be situations where resources shall be hidden in the navigation
but still be nested in another resource. In this case you keep the route but configure the dashboard to not be displayed in the navigation.

```ruby
class LineItemDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  configure do |config|
    config.navigation = false
  end
end
```

Each `FooDashboard` specifies which attributes should be displayed
on the admin dashboard for the `Foo` resource.

Each `Admin::FooController` can be overwritten to specify custom behavior.

Once you have Administrate installed,
visit <http://localhost:3000/admin> to see your new dashboard in action.

## Create Additional Dashboards

In order to create additional dashboards, pass in the resource name to
the dashboard generator. A dashboard and controller will be created.

```bash
$ rails generate administrate:dashboard Foo
```

Add a route for the new dashboard.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

namespace :admin do
  resources :foos
end
```

## Using a Custom Namespace

Administrate supports using a namespace other than `Admin`, such as
`Supervisor`. This will also change the route it's using:

```sh
rails generate administrate:install --namespace=supervisor
```

## Keep Dashboards Updated as Model Attributes Change

If you've installed Administrate and generated dashboards and _then_ 
subsequently added attributes to your models you'll need to manually add 
these additions (or removals) to your dashboards.

Example:

```ruby
# app/dashboards/your_model_dashboard.rb

  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    # ...
    the_new_attribute: Field::String,
    # ...
  }.freeze
  
  SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES = [
    # ...
    :the_new_attribute,
    # ...
  ].freeze

  FORM_ATTRIBUTES = [
    # ...
    :the_new_attribute,
    # ...
  ].freeze
  
  COLLECTION_ATTRIBUTES = [
    # ...
    :the_new_attribute, # if you want it on the index, also.
    # ...
  ].freeze
```

It's recommended that you make this change at the same time as you add the 
attribute to the model.

The alternative way to handle this is to re-run `rails g administrate:install`
and carefully pick through the diffs. This latter method is probably more
cumbersome.
