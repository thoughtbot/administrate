## What Is Administrate?

Administrate is a library for Rails apps
that automatically generates admin dashboards.
Administrate's admin dashboards give non-technical users clean interfaces
that allow them to create, edit, search, and delete records
for any model in the application.

Administrate solves the same problem as [Rails Admin] and [ActiveAdmin],
but aims to provide a better user experience for site admins,
and to be easier for developers to customize.

To accomplish these goals, Administrate follows a few guiding principles:

- No DSLs (domain-specific languages)
- Support the simplest use cases, and let the user override defaults with
  standard tools such as plain Rails controllers and views.
- Break up the library into core components and plugins,
  so each component stays small and easy to maintain.

## Getting Started

Administrate supports Rails from 4.2, up to 5.0 and beyond. We support Ruby
2.4 and up.

Add Administrate to your Gemfile and re-bundle:

```ruby
gem "administrate"
```

The included installer will create dashboards for each model in your
app, complete with routes:

```bash
$ rails generate administrate:install
```

Restart your server, and visit http://localhost:3000/admin
to see your new dashboard in action.

For more detailed instructions or to make it work with Rails API-only applications, please go through the ['Getting Started` guide](https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com/getting_started).

If your apps uses Sprockets 4, you'll need to add Administrate's assets to your `manifest.js` file. To do this, add these two lines to the file:

```
//= link administrate/application.css
//= link administrate/application.js
```

Otherwise, your app will show you this error:

```
Asset `administrate/application.css` was not declared to be precompiled in production.
Declare links to your assets in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`.
```

For more information on why this is necessary, see https://www.schneems.com/2017/11/22/self-hosted-config-introducing-the-sprockets-manifestjs

## Create Additional Dashboards

In order to create additional dashboards, pass in the resource name to
the dashboard generator. A dashboard and controller will be created.

```bash
$ rails generate administrate:dashboard Foo
```

## Documentation

To customize the appearance, behavior, and contents of the dashboard,
see the guides at
[https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com][prototype_heroku].
These guides are available as markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory of the
git repository, too.
