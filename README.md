## What Is Administrate?

Administrate is a library for Rails apps
that automatically generates admin dashboards.
Administrate's admin dashboards give non-technical users clean interfaces
that allow them to create, edit, search, and delete records
for any model in the application.

Administrate solves the same problem as [Rails Admin] and [ActiveAdmin],
but aims to provide a better user experience for site admins,
and to be easier for developers to customize.

To accomplish these goals, Administrate follows a few guiding principles:

- No DSLs (domain-specific languages)
- Support the simplest use cases, and let the user override defaults with
  standard tools such as plain Rails controllers and views.
- Break up the library into core components and plugins,
  so each component stays small and easy to maintain.
