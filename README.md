A framework for creating flexible, powerful admin dashboards in Rails.
[Try the demo][demo].

## What Is Administrate?

Administrate is a library for Rails apps
that automatically generates admin dashboards.
Administrate's admin dashboards give non-technical users clean interfaces
that allow them to create, edit, search, and delete records
for any model in the application.

Administrate solves the same problem as [Rails Admin] and [ActiveAdmin],
but aims to provide a better user experience for site admins,
and to be easier for developers to customize.

To accomplish these goals, Administrate follows a few guiding principles:

- No DSLs (domain-specific languages)
- Support the simplest use cases, and let the user override defaults with
  standard tools such as plain Rails controllers and views.
- Break up the library into core components and plugins,
  so each component stays small and easy to maintain.

## Getting Started

Administrate supports Rails from 4.2, up to 5.0 and beyond.

Add Administrate to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "administrate"
```

Re-bundle, then run the installer:

```bash
$ rails generate administrate:install
```

Restart your server, and visit http://localhost:3000/admin
to see your new dashboard in action.

## Create Additional Dashboards

In order to create additional dashboards, pass in the resource name to 
the dashboard generator. A dashboard and controller will be created.

```bash
$ rails generate administrate:dashboard Foo
```

## Documentation

To customize the appearance, behavior, and contents of the dashboard,
see the guides at
[https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com][prototype_heroku].
These guides are available as markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory of the
git repository, too.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains both the source code for Administrate,
and a demo Rails app that uses Administrate.
The demo app is [hosted publicly on Heroku][demo].

- The gem's source code lives in the `app` and `lib` subdirectories.
- The demo app is nested within `spec/example_app`.
- The guides as seen at
  [https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com][prototype_heroku] live as
  markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory.

Rails configuration files have been changed
to recognize the app in the new location,
so running the server or deploying to Heroku works normally.

With this structure, developing a typical feature looks like:

- Add tests in `spec/`
- Implement a feature in `administrate/`
- Exercise the feature using the demo rails app (`spec/example_app/app/`)

## Front-end Architecture

This project uses:

- Sass
- [BEM]-style CSS selectors, with [namespaces]
- Autoprefixer
- SCSS-Lint, with [Hound] ([configuration](.scss-lint.yml))
- A variety of CSS units:
  - `em` for typographical-related elements
  - `rem` for lengths related to components
  - `px` for borders, text shadows, etc.
  - `vw`/`vh` for lengths that should be relational to the viewport
