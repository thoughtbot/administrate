### Danger: breaking changes are common.

Administrate remains pre-1.0,
and breaking changes can occur as our designs respond
based on our user's needs.

Please pin on a "minor version" number,
should you need a more reliable application build.
Make sure you see remarks included in our [release log],
prior upgrading your dependency.

## Administrate's Purpose

Administrate is a Rails-based engine,
made so coders can spend less energy modeling necessary
super-user dashboards across a broad range
of program shapes and sizes.

No special experience is needed by our dashboard's users,
and no special languages are required of our dashboard's coders.

Basic operations include adding, dropping, changing, searching records,
and permissions are managed in a simple class-based modeling layer.

Administrate had been preceded by [Rails Admin] and [ActiveAdmin],
and has been inspired in many areas by such approaches.
Administrate yearns for a more simple, common-ground approach
in describing and accomplishing common program use cases.

## Administrate's guiding principles

- No DSLs (domain-specific languages)

- Enable simple and common use cases,
  and encourage use case expansion
  based on usual Rails programming paradigms.

- Compose our engine based on small core classes,
  and encourage a plugin-based ecology made by our users.

we publish a set [of guides for the current release][guides].

These guides are available as markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory of the
